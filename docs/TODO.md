# Qling Design Integration TODO

## Scope Statement

This document is the execution plan for aligning the production Qling app with the static `design/` delivery package. It is written for a developer who does not know the project context and must be able to execute the work phase by phase without guessing.

`design/` is a static design delivery package, not production code. It contains fixed 393px x 852px screen references, screen-local SVG/image assets, preview routing, hardcoded sample data, fake status bars/home indicators, and preview-only dependencies. Production routing, state, API integration, Firestore behavior, moderation behavior, matching behavior, read models, push/PWA behavior, account deletion, accessibility, and complete UX flows must be implemented in the production app.

Checkboxes may only be checked after implementation exists and verification evidence exists. Do not check a box based only on visual similarity when functional behavior is not wired. Do not copy `design/` static screens directly into production without replacing hardcoded text/data and reconnecting production behavior. Preserve the deep module structure: domain logic, Firestore/API details, moderation, matching, read-model logic, push/PWA logic, and account logic must remain in service/domain modules or route-level adapters, not presentational UI components.

Each phase is intended to be executed and reviewed independently before the next phase starts. Phase order and checkbox order are the execution order. Implementation phases may create minimal functional screen skeletons before final visual reskin so routes and behavior can be tested early, but full visual polishing, token work, and screen-by-screen visual alignment remain the visual phases.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing the production app with the design preview app.
- Importing all dependencies from `design/package.json` into production.
- Moving Firebase, Firestore/API, moderation, matching, read-model, push/PWA, or account deletion logic into presentational screen components.
- Adding speculative features beyond what is needed to make production match the approved `design/` interpretation.
- Refactoring unrelated services, tests, or documents.

## Completion Definition

Design integration is complete only when every checkbox in this document is checked with evidence. Completion means every `design/` screen has a matching production route/screen or a documented intentional product-level exclusion, all required product decisions are resolved before Phase 2 begins, functional gaps are implemented before visual reskin work, automated tests and required rules tests pass, manual/browser verification covers non-automatable responsive/PWA cases, and production remains aligned with `docs/PRD.md`.

## Evidence Rules

- Automated test evidence means the command and passing output are copied into the PR description or linked CI run.
- Manual screenshot evidence means screenshots are attached for the named route/state and viewport.
- Manual browser-note evidence means the PR checklist records browser, viewport/device, route/state, result, and date.
- Emulator/manual-equivalent evidence means either a passing emulator test output or a written manual-equivalent verification note when the emulator cannot cover the case.
- Product-decision evidence means a PRD update, ADR, issue comment, or PR checklist section that records the decision, owner, date, and chosen behavior.

## Detailed Phased TODO Checklist

### Phase 0 - Design Inventory And Production-Gap Audit

- [x] TODO-DESIGN-0.1 Inspect `design/README.md`, `design/package.json`, every `design/src/screens/**/Component.tsx`, all screen-local SVG/image assets, `design/src/styles/index.css`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/index.css`, `src/services/appShell/prdNavigationPolicy.ts`, `src/services/validation/content.ts`, `src/services/drafts/contentDrafts.ts`, the service folders named in this TODO, `packages/domain/src/index.ts`, `firestore.rules`, `src/firestore.rules.test.ts`, and existing related tests; evidence: PR checklist entry with inspected file list and date.
- [x] TODO-DESIGN-0.2 Create a single screen-to-route mapping table covering every design screen: `splash`, `loading`, `login`, `onboarding-basic`, `onboarding-duplicate`, `onboarding-interests`, `received-worries`, `question-write-a`, `question-write-b`, `answer-write-1`, `answer-write-2`, `answer-write-3`, `answer-check`, `my-page`, `edit-interests`, `my-answers`, `my-worries`, `privacy-policy`, operation-policy access if implemented through a policy index/detail route, `logout`, and `account-deletion`; evidence: table with columns `Design screen`, `Production route/state`, `Functional behavior required`, `Visual-only/variant/exclusion`, `Data source`, `Verification`.
- [x] TODO-DESIGN-0.3 Classify each design screen in the table as one of: required functional screen, confirmation/modal variant, visual variant of another screen, or intentional product-level exclusion.
- [x] TODO-DESIGN-0.4 Record production gaps discovered from the audit, including onboarding identity fields, onboarding duplicate check, explicit onboarding subroutes, edit interests, my answers, my worries, privacy policy, logout confirmation, account deletion confirmation, answer-check/detail mapping, bottom navigation, and static-design data replacement.
- [x] TODO-DESIGN-0.5 Record design tokens and motifs: SUIT font, orange `#ff8b3d`/`#ff8b0d`, cream `#fff1d1`/`#fff5eb`, dark text `#1a1a1a`/`#2a2a2a`, muted gray `#b8b8b8`, border gray `#dadce0`/`#f0f0f2`, pill/card/modal radii, card/modal shadows, orange header band, cream content sheet, bottom navigation, category chips, white cards, text areas, CTA styles, modal styles, and profile eye/avatar motif.
- [x] TODO-DESIGN-0.6 Record implementation warnings: fixed absolute positioning, fake status bars, fake home indicators, hardcoded sample names/dates/counts/content, lorem ipsum, preview-only routing, fixed 393px-only layout, and blind copying of `design/package.json` dependencies are not acceptable production implementation.
- [x] TODO-DESIGN-0.7 Verify this TODO states that `design/` is static and production routing/state/API/UX flows must be implemented in production modules.
- [x] TODO-DESIGN-0.V1 Verify Phase 0 with the completed mapping table, gap list, token list, and implementation-warning list attached as PR evidence before checking this item.

### Phase 1 - Product Model And Schema Decisions Before UI

Phase 2 must not begin until Phase 1 verifies that the current `docs/PRD.md` product decisions are reflected in this TODO and downstream implementation items. If a TODO item conflicts with `docs/PRD.md`, treat the PRD as the source of truth and stop to update this TODO before implementation. Phase 1 checkboxes are decision, reflection, and implementation-target gates only; do not check them based on production code changes unless the item only asks for verification of already-existing behavior.

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.1 Verify nickname required behavior from `docs/PRD.md`: onboarding must collect nickname, nickname duplicate check remains in the flow, nickname and age are added to stored profile data, and nickname is visible only to the signed-in user in the my-page profile summary.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.2 Define profile fields exactly: display nickname field, normalized nickname field, trim behavior, min/max length, allowed characters, blocked characters, error copy, and whether nickname can be changed after onboarding; ensure nickname exposure is limited to the my-page profile summary and does not appear in my answers, answer detail, other-user screens, worry cards, reply cards, example worries, or notification copy.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.3 Define duplicate-check behavior exactly: route/state location, trigger, idle/checking/available/duplicate/invalid/network-failed/retry states, disabled submit rules, and display copy.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.4 Define nickname uniqueness persistence exactly for implementation: server/API transaction using normalized nickname reservation documents, not client-only Firestore checks; keep the PRD wording limited to server-side final duplicate-check guarantee.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.5 Verify nickname rejection/removal paths are not implemented because nickname is required by the current PRD; evidence must show onboarding basic, duplicate-check, and my-page summary all follow required-nickname behavior.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.6 Verify age required behavior from `docs/PRD.md`: age is mandatory, persisted to `users/{uid}.age`, validated during onboarding, included in data policy, and not used for MVP matching sort/filter logic.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.7 Define `users/{uid}.age` type, allowed range, validation copy, persistence path, rules behavior, and matching non-use exactly; use the current PRD range of 14 through 99 unless the product owner updates the PRD.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.8 Verify age rejection/removal paths are not implemented because age is required by the current PRD; evidence must show onboarding basic preserves required age input and validation.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.9 Verify the target category value from `docs/PRD.md` and `packages/domain/src/index.ts`: the production domain/display value is `워라밸`; existing data, seed/example worries, and test fixtures must not be migrated away from `워라밸`; if truly legacy misspellings exist in data, record them only as explicit compatibility input targets and not as the target domain value.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.10 Verify received hearts behavior: `받은 하트` displays existing `helpedCount` and browser UI code does not mutate `helpedCount` directly.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.11 Keep the design eye/profile motif as a design implementation detail only; do not add avatar upload or avatar fields to the product model unless the PRD later adds them.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.12 Define profile display-name fallback under required-nickname behavior: my-page summary may display the user's nickname, but fallback identity must not leak into other users' screens, worry/reply cards, my-answer lists, or answer details.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.13 Define policy behavior from `docs/PRD.md`: keep privacy policy and operation policy only, exclude terms and a dedicated usage-guide screen from MVP, do not show policy links on login, expose policy access only from my-page/more, use `docs/privacy_policy.md` and `docs/operation_policy.md` as policy body sources, allow those files to be empty, and show a production-safe empty state such as policy body preparation without adding fake policy copy; record Phase 2 route targets and Phase 10/20 implementation targets.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.14 Verify the Phase 1 PRD reflection record in the implementation PR checklist; it must confirm nickname, age, duplicate check, helpedCount/received hearts, avatar-as-design-detail, display-name exposure limits, privacy/operation policy behavior, PWA install/share, push notification settings, bottom navigation, publish-success routing, category value, example-worry indistinguishability, hidden-content behavior, and my-page edit scope.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.15 Add validation/schema test targets to the implementation plan: domain category tests in `packages/domain/src/index.test.ts`; LLM category validation/fallback/matching tests proving `워라밸` is valid; any legacy misspelling coverage must be explicit compatibility-input coverage only; content validation remains in `src/services/validation/content.test.ts`; profile nickname and required age validation tests go in a new service test such as `src/services/userProfile/profileValidation.test.ts` or `src/services/authProfile/profileIdentity.test.ts` if that module owns the logic.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.16 Add nickname uniqueness test targets: normalized nickname validation, duplicate check result mapping, reservation transaction conflict, concurrent/race conflict behavior, and Firestore rules preventing unsafe direct client writes.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.17 Add Firestore rules test targets in `src/firestore.rules.test.ts` for nickname reservation docs, server-owned nickname fields, required age persistence, and age validation/rules behavior; note whether `npm run test:rules` is required in Phase 24.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-1.GATE Verify the PRD reflection gate: all current `docs/PRD.md` product decisions are reflected in this TODO, and Phase 2+ implementation items do not contradict the PRD.

### Phase 2 - Route And App-Shell Functional Expansion

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.1 Update route types and helper functions in `src/services/appShell/prdNavigationPolicy.ts`; no route helper may live only inside a presentational component.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.2 Remove or deprecate `usage_guide` and generic `policy` routing from the production route policy unless a PRD-approved route is added; keep explicit privacy policy and operation policy routes/states only.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.3 Add route/state coverage for splash/loading, login, onboarding basic, onboarding duplicate check, onboarding gender/age, onboarding interests, received worries/answer feed, write worry, write reply, received-answer detail, my-answer detail, answer/reply check visual state as applicable, my page, edit interests, my answers, my worries, privacy policy, operation policy, logout confirmation, and account deletion confirmation.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.4 Implement current PRD route semantics: default authenticated route to received worries/answer feed, onboarding completion to received worries/answer feed after profile/examples are ready, worry publish success to the newly written worry detail with enough created worry id information to resolve that detail, reply publish success to the newly written my-answer detail with enough created reply id information to resolve that detail, and pass success to received worries/answer feed.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.5 Define back routes for write worry, write reply, received-answer detail, my-answer detail, edit interests, my answers, my worries, privacy policy, operation policy, logout confirmation, and account deletion confirmation.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.6 Define bottom-tab ownership for nested routes: received worries/write reply under `답변하기`, my worries/write worry/received-answer detail under `나의 고민`, and my page/edit interests/my answers/my-answer detail/privacy policy/operation policy/logout/account deletion/settings subroutes under `마이페이지`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.7 Define the central bottom-navigation action contract: the center visual/action is labeled or announced as `고민 작성`, remains visually/semantically connected to the `나의 고민` area, and navigates to write worry rather than merely switching to the my-worries tab.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.8 Create minimal functional screen skeletons only where needed to exercise new routes before visual reskin; skeletons must use real route state and callbacks, not static design data.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.9 Add route-policy tests in `src/services/appShell/prdNavigationPolicy.test.ts` for removing/deprecating `usage_guide` and generic `policy`, default authenticated route, onboarding completion, worry publish success to written worry detail with created worry id resolution, reply publish success to my-answer detail with created reply id resolution, pass success to received worries/answer feed, every back route, my-page subroutes, logout/account deletion routes, explicit privacy/operation policy routes, bottom-tab selection, and central write-worry action routing.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-2.V1 Verify Phase 2 with passing `src/services/appShell/prdNavigationPolicy.test.ts`, a route map diff, and evidence that route policy did not move into UI components.

### Phase 3 - App Shell Responsibility And Route Rendering Boundary

Phase 3 must constrain `src/App.tsx` before new route and screen work increases its current mix of Firebase, Firestore, route, onboarding, publication, pass, feedback, push/PWA, account, and rendering responsibility.

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-3.1 Inventory current `src/App.tsx` responsibilities and classify each as app-shell orchestration, route rendering, feature container logic, or presentational screen rendering.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-3.2 Define the app-shell boundary: auth/profile loading, top-level route selection, global overlays, and shell-level providers may stay in app shell; feature data wiring must move to route containers.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-3.3 Extract or identify route rendering boundaries for authenticated shell, onboarding flow, received worries, write worry, write reply, reply details, my-page/account, and policy screens.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-3.4 Record the maximum allowed `src/App.tsx` responsibilities before Phase 5 starts; if route expansion increases responsibility beyond that boundary, split route rendering into dedicated shell/container files in this phase before continuing.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-3.5 Verify no visual reskin work begins in this phase beyond minimal route skeletons needed to test routing.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-3.V1 Verify Phase 3 with a file/module map, App-shell responsibility notes, and evidence that route rendering boundaries exist before screen contract work starts.

### Phase 4 - Presentational Screen Contract Definition

Presentational screen contracts must be defined before container wiring. Presentational components must receive props and emit events only; they must not import Firebase, Firestore SDK, API clients, service implementation internals, moderation, matching, read-state, push/PWA, or account deletion logic.

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.1 Define screen props contracts for login/loading/splash screens, including auth/loading/error/submit props and no Firebase imports.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.2 Define screen props contracts for onboarding basic, duplicate check, and interests, including field values, validation messages, submit/check callbacks, processing states, and no Firestore/API imports.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.3 Define screen props contracts for received-worries, including feed items, pass/open callbacks, loading/error/empty states, unread state, and no delivery API imports; do not include a completed-reply display state because replied deliveries must be excluded from the answer feed.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.4 Define screen props contracts for write-worry and write-reply forms, including draft value, validation result, character count, publish callback, processing/moderation/error states, and no publication API imports.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.5 Define screen props contracts for reply-check/detail screens, including original worry, reply, feedback, comment, submit callbacks, existing-feedback states, and no feedback API imports.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.6 Define screen props contracts for my-page/account screens, including profile summary, helpedCount/received hearts, interests, required push notification settings access, required PWA install/share access, policy settings items, logout/delete callbacks, and no Firebase/userAccount imports.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.7 Add pure props-contract tests in named targets near the screen contract modules, such as `src/screens/receivedWorries/contract.test.ts`, `src/screens/writeForm/contract.test.ts`, and `src/screens/myPage/contract.test.ts`; do not require React DOM rendering tests unless a React test harness is deliberately added.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.8 If a React DOM component test harness is added deliberately, document the dependency, setup file, and first test target; otherwise rely on pure props-contract tests, import-boundary tests, service tests, and manual browser evidence.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-4.V1 Verify Phase 4 with contract definitions and props-contract test output before container wiring begins.

### Phase 5 - Received-Worries Container Boundary

Functional screen phases must use real production data sources and production route state. Skeleton data is allowed only when explicitly marked as temporary, isolated to non-user-facing route exercise, and removed before the corresponding functional phase verification item is checked.

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-5.1 Implement received-worries container wiring to `useHomeWorryFeed`, `filterSuppressedFeedWorries`, and route helpers.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-5.2 Keep pass behavior in the container/service path using `passDeliveryViaApi`, delivery suppression policy, loading-by-delivery-id state, and feed refresh behavior.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-5.3 Keep open-for-reply behavior in the container/service path using selected worry state, route helpers, and read-state marking.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-5.4 Ensure the received-worries presentational screen only receives props and emits events; it must not import delivery APIs, read-state APIs, Firebase, or service internals.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-5.5 Verify no visual reskin work begins in this phase beyond minimal functional UI needed to exercise the container.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-5.V1 Verify Phase 5 with container notes, props-contract tests, and manual browser-note evidence for a functional received-worries skeleton.

### Phase 6 - Write Forms Container Boundary

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-6.1 Implement write-worry container wiring to `validateDraftContent`, `CONTENT_MAX_LENGTH`, worry draft state, `publishWorryViaApi`, moderation result display, draft clearing, and route helpers.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-6.2 Implement write-reply container wiring to selected delivery/worry data, reply draft keyed by delivery id, `publishReplyViaApi`, moderation result display, draft clearing, feed refresh, and route helpers.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-6.3 Ensure write form presentational components only receive props and emit events; they must not import publication APIs, Firebase, draft services, or validation service internals unless validation result is explicitly part of a shared pure UI contract.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-6.4 Verify no visual reskin work begins in this phase beyond minimal functional UI needed to exercise publication flows.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-6.V1 Verify Phase 6 with container notes, props-contract tests, and manual screenshot evidence for functional write-worry/write-reply skeletons.

### Phase 7 - My-Page/Account/Reply-Detail Container Boundary

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-7.1 Implement my-page/account container wiring to profile data, helpedCount/received hearts, interests, settings items, real push permission/FCM registration/status hooks, PWA install/share hooks, sign-out cleanup, and `deleteMyAccountViaApi`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-7.2 Implement my-answers/my-worries container wiring to `useMyGivenReplies`, `useMyWorries`, `useRepliesForWorry`, selected item state, route helpers, and read-state behavior where applicable.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-7.3 Implement reply-detail container wiring to original worry data, reply data, feedback submit, publisher comment submit, moderation rejection display, draft clearing, and route helpers.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-7.4 Ensure my-page/account/reply-detail presentational screens only receive props and emit events; they must not import Firebase, userAccount APIs, push internals, feedback APIs, read-state APIs, or Firestore SDK.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-7.5 Verify no visual reskin work begins in this phase beyond minimal functional UI needed to exercise account/detail flows.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-7.V1 Verify Phase 7 with container notes, props-contract tests, and manual browser-note evidence for functional my-page/account/reply-detail skeletons.

### Phase 8 - Import-Boundary And Deep Module Guardrail Verification

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-8.1 Add import-boundary tests in a named target such as `src/ui/importBoundaries.test.ts` or `src/screens/importBoundaries.test.ts`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-8.2 Import-boundary tests must fail if presentational screen files import `src/firebase`, API clients, server modules, Firestore SDK, Firebase auth SDK, or service implementation internals.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-8.3 Verify route policy remains in `src/services/appShell/prdNavigationPolicy.ts` and route-policy tests remain in `src/services/appShell/prdNavigationPolicy.test.ts`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-8.4 Verify domain/service logic remains in `src/services/**` and `packages/domain/**`, not presentational components.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-8.5 Verify `src/App.tsx` did not grow into a larger monolith after Phases 3-7.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-8.V1 Verify Phase 8 with import-boundary test output, route-policy test output, and a module-boundary review note; this is a hard gate before Phase 9 functional product implementation and before any visual reskin.

### Phase 9 - Onboarding Functional Implementation

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.1 Implement the finalized PRD onboarding flow using minimal functional skeletons first if the final visual reskin is not ready: nickname input, nickname duplicate check, gender/age input, interests selection, example worry creation, then answer feed.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.2 Implement nickname validation in the service location chosen in Phase 1 and add tests for trimming, normalization, min/max length, allowed characters, blocked characters, and error copy.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.3 Implement duplicate-check behavior with idle/checking/available/duplicate/invalid/network-failed/retry states and disabled continue until availability is proven.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.4 Implement server/API transaction or reservation logic and tests for duplicate reservation, normalized-name conflict, and concurrent/race conflict behavior.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.5 Add Firestore rules coverage in `src/firestore.rules.test.ts` proving unsafe client writes to nickname reservation docs or server-owned nickname fields are denied.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.6 Implement required age validation, persistence to `users/{uid}.age`, rules behavior, and tests for valid, invalid, empty, and boundary ages.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.7 Verify age is not used in MVP matching sort/filter logic and no age-removal onboarding adaptation is implemented under the current PRD.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.8 Preserve gender persistence and rules behavior already covered by `src/firestore.rules.test.ts`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.9 Preserve interests persistence using domain category values, including `워라밸`; update onboarding tests and fixtures so `워라밸` remains the target domain/display value and any truly legacy misspelling is handled only as explicit compatibility input.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.10 Preserve server-owned example worry creation before entering the authenticated feed, and verify example worries are not labeled, badged, or otherwise distinguished from real worries in production UI.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.11 Preserve onboarding completion route transition from Phase 2.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.12 Add or update onboarding service/container tests in the relevant new or existing service test files for valid onboarding, invalid required fields, duplicate nickname, required age, profile persistence, example worry creation, and route transition.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.13 Add manual browser-note evidence for first-time sign-in through onboarding at 393px before final reskin, proving the functional skeleton works end to end.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-9.V1 Verify Phase 9 with onboarding tests, nickname/rules tests if applicable, and the manual browser-note evidence.

### Phase 10 - My-Page/Account Functional Expansion

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.1 Implement profile summary using dynamic nickname, interests, PRD-approved self-profile fields only, and helpedCount/received hearts; keep avatar motif as visual detail and do not expose nickname outside my-page summary.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.2 Implement edit-interests route/state backed by existing profile update behavior for interests only; gender is not editable in MVP and no gender edit UI should be added.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.3 Implement my-answers route/state backed by `useMyGivenReplies`, with dynamic list items and detail navigation; include replies to example worries exactly like real replies and hide any content suppressed by moderation/admin policy.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.4 Implement my-worries route/state backed by `useMyWorries` and `useRepliesForWorry`, with dynamic list items and received replies navigation; hide worries and replies suppressed by moderation/admin policy from both publisher and answerer views.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.5 Implement privacy policy and operation policy route/state using `docs/privacy_policy.md` and `docs/operation_policy.md` as body sources; if a source file is empty, show a production-safe empty state such as policy body preparation; do not add fake policy copy and do not implement terms or a dedicated usage-guide route for MVP.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.6 Implement logout confirmation route/state before calling existing sign-out behavior.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.7 Implement account deletion confirmation route/state before calling `deleteMyAccountViaApi`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.8 Preserve logout cleanup: local push registration state is cleared and Firebase auth signs out.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.9 Preserve account deletion cleanup: server deletion path runs, local push state is cleaned, and user is signed out.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.10 Preserve required push notification settings access in my-page/more with real Web Push permission request, FCM registration, and granted/denied/default status display; do not reduce this to static guidance.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.11 Preserve required PWA install/share access in my-page/more as an "앱처럼 사용하기" flow covering Android install, iOS share-to-home-screen guidance, and service URL/QR sharing as applicable.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.12 Add route-policy tests for my-page subroutes in `src/services/appShell/prdNavigationPolicy.test.ts`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.13 Add account behavior tests in existing account/push locations, including `src/services/userAccount/deleteMyAccount.test.ts` and `src/services/pushRegistration/internalLifecycle.test.ts` when cleanup behavior changes; push tests must cover permission request, FCM registration, and status mapping when touched.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.14 Add pure props-contract tests for helpedCount fallback, destructive-action confirmation props, and settings item routing in the my-page contract test target from Phase 4.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.15 Add manual screenshot evidence for my page, logout confirmation, and account deletion confirmation using dynamic data, proving hardcoded design values such as `라미` and `314` are gone.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-10.V1 Verify Phase 10 with route tests, account/push tests, props-contract tests, and manual screenshot evidence.

### Phase 11 - Received Worries And Pass/Reply Functional Alignment

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.1 Wire received-worries data to `useHomeWorryFeed` and `filterSuppressedFeedWorries`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.2 Render dynamic category, received-time/fallback copy, unread state, worry content, loading, error, and empty states; exclude deliveries/replies that have already been answered from the received-worries feed instead of rendering a completed-reply state.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.3 Ensure card body opens write reply through route helpers and marks delivery read where applicable.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.4 Ensure `건너뛰기` maps to existing `passDeliveryViaApi` behavior, not UI-only removal.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.5 Ensure pass click does not trigger card body open.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.6 Ensure pass loading/disabled state is keyed by delivery id and prevents duplicate mutation.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.7 Ensure pass success suppresses/hides the delivery and refreshes feed behavior correctly.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.8 Ensure pass failure preserves the card, clears loading, and displays the existing error path.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.9 Preserve unread/read-state behavior through existing read-state service/API modules.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.10 Add or update tests in existing delivery/feed/read-state locations: `src/services/deliveries/uiPolicy.test.ts`, `src/services/deliveries/passDelivery.test.ts`, `src/services/homeWorryFeed/prdPolicy.test.ts`, `src/services/homeWorryFeed/apiClient.test.ts`, and read-state tests as behavior changes require; include coverage that answered deliveries/replies and hidden worries/replies are excluded from the answer feed/read model.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-11.11 Add pure props-contract tests for card open, pass click isolation, pass loading, answered-item exclusion from props, empty state, and error state.

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-14.6 Implement the bottom navigation primitive contract from Phase 2: left `답변하기`, central `고민 작성` action that routes to write worry, right `마이페이지`, default authenticated screen on `답변하기`, active-tab mapping through route policy, and `write_worry` owned visually/semantically by the `나의 고민` area while still navigating directly to write worry.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-14.7 Implement shell spacing primitives for bottom-navigation height, scroll-container bottom padding, `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`, and CTA/form/list overlap prevention so Phases 17-20 can integrate screen-specific spacing without inventing the shell.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-14.8 Add route-policy or primitive contract tests for bottom-tab mapping and central write-worry action if not already fully covered by Phase 2 tests.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-14.9 Acceptance criteria: 393px width preserves the design hierarchy and main layout; 360px, 430px, and desktop widths remain usable and not clipped.

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-14.11 Acceptance criteria: dynamic content may expand layout; pixel-perfect copying is not required when it harms accessibility, readability, or production data.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-14.12 Acceptance criteria: color, font, CTA, card, chip, bottom-nav, modal, text-area, and profile motif alignment are visually recognizable against `design/`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-14.13 Add pure props-contract tests for primitive state mappings where useful; do not require React DOM rendering tests unless a harness was deliberately added in Phase 4.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-14.14 Add manual screenshot evidence for primitives or first integrated screens at 393px, 360px, 430px, and desktop preview, including bottom navigation and central write-worry action.

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-20.V1 Verify Phase 20 with screenshots/browser notes and account/push/route test output.

### Phase 21 - Static Hardcoded Data Audit And Visual Acceptance Pass

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-21.1 Audit that earlier phases did not introduce static hardcoded design data where dynamic data is required, including sample names, dates, counts, worry text, reply text, lorem ipsum, and any production UI marker that labels an example worry as example/sample/tutorial content; fix only defects found by this audit, not deferred cleanup from earlier phases.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-21.2 Verify no production screen uses fake status bars or fake home indicators from `design/`; all mobile chrome spacing must be safe-area-aware production layout.

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-22.3 Audit active tab highlighting for nested write reply, write worry, received-answer detail, my-answer detail, edit interests, my answers, privacy policy, operation policy, logout confirmation, and account deletion confirmation; `write_worry` remains owned by the `나의 고민` tab.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-22.4 Audit the central orange action as a `고민 작성` shortcut that calls `routeToWriteWorry()` or the equivalent route helper and navigates to `write_worry`; it must not behave as a simple `나의 고민` tab switch.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-22.5 Polish any remaining bottom-navigation overlap defects so the shell does not cover form CTAs, card lists, modals, or final scroll content.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-22.6 Polish any remaining scroll-container bottom padding defects based on nav height and `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-22.7 Add or update route-policy tests in `src/services/appShell/prdNavigationPolicy.test.ts` only for bottom-tab mappings changed during this polish phase; Phase 2/14 should already cover default route to `답변하기`, `write_worry` ownership by `나의 고민`, and central action navigation to write worry.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-22.8 Add manual screenshot evidence for final bottom nav at 393px, 360px, 430px, and desktop preview.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-22.9 Add manual-only PWA/browser notes for final iOS safe-area behavior and Android Chrome/PWA bottom navigation behavior; do not treat these as automated tests.

### Phase 23 - Accessibility, Responsive Behavior, And Production Hardening

- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.1 Replace fragile absolute positioning from design references with responsive production layouts wherever dynamic data can change size.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.2 Preserve visual similarity to `design/`, but prefer accessible responsive layout over pixel-perfect copying when they conflict.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.3 Verify long Korean worry, reply, feedback comment, required nickname in its allowed my-page summary location, `워라밸` category chip wrapping, and privacy/operation policy text remain readable without clipping.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.4 Verify all controls use semantic `button`, `a`, `input`, `textarea`, or appropriate ARIA roles.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.5 Verify destructive actions are clearly confirmed, visually differentiated, and disabled while processing.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.6 Verify color contrast for orange CTAs, cream backgrounds, muted gray text, disabled controls, danger buttons, and chip labels.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.7 Verify keyboard focus order for login, onboarding, write forms, feedback forms, settings list, logout confirmation, and account deletion confirmation.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.8 Verify screen-reader labels for icon-only or visually abstract controls, including bottom nav, back buttons, notification/settings icons, pass, feedback, close/cancel, and destructive actions.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.9 Add manual screenshot evidence for mobile widths 360px, 393px, 430px, and desktop preview across representative routes.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.10 Add manual-only PWA and push notes for iOS home-screen/safe-area/share behavior, Android PWA install/open behavior, and notification permission granted/denied/default states with FCM registration status where supported.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.11 Add browser-note evidence for loading, error, empty, disabled, and processing states on every production route.
- [ ] TODO-DESIGN-23.V1 Verify Phase 23 with accessibility notes, responsive screenshots, PWA manual-only notes, and any added hardening tests.
